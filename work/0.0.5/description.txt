in this netowrk worked 2 neural networks.

Uses a chrome_stf feature.
It works like this:

  1.
  Get sound 
  
  2.
  Split sound by 300 milliseconds
  
  3.
  get features chrome_stf from this sounds
  
  4.
  forward each sounds in feature to first network, network for each sound return "firk" or "hmm" or "space"
  
  5.
  list of returned first networtk is resizes to 16.
  
  6.
  this 16 forward to second network
  
  7.
  second network return answer, this sound is "firk", "hmm", or "space"
